# Sample Ruby Project Template

We want to spend more time building cool stuff and less time configuring
things. Use this as a starter template for your next Ruby project, ie.
when you're not using Rails.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cvcnetwork/sample_ruby.git my_awesome_project_name
```

Create a [new repo on GitHub](https://github.com/organizations/cvcnetwork/repositories/new) and then set the URL for the origin branch to this new repo.

```bash
cd my_awesome_project_name
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/cvcnetwork/my_awesome_project_name.git
```

Then you're good to start making something amazing.
